/**
 * Renders the player's equipped vanilla armor (helmet/chestplate/leggings/boots) while a GeckoLib ability
 * animation is driving the body pose. GeckoRenderPlayer's own class javadoc documents this as intentionally
 * dropped: vanilla's HumanoidArmorLayer needs a live ModelPart tree to copy the current pose onto (via
 * HumanoidModel#setupAnim), and GeckoLib 5 doesn't expose a bone's world transform outside its own live render
 * traversal, so there was no way to keep a *separately posed* vanilla armor model in sync with the GeckoLib body.
 * <p>
 * This sidesteps that problem instead of solving it: each armor ModelPart is positioned using the player bone's
 * live, current-frame transform, reconstructed via {@code RenderUtil.transformToBone} (walking the bone's parent
 * chain and applying each ancestor's baked keyframe pose) rather than posing an independent armor model and hoping
 * it matches.
 * <p>
 * <b>CRASH HISTORY - do not "simplify" this back to addBonePositionListener</b>: an earlier version registered a
 * {@code RenderPassInfo#addBonePositionListener} callback per bone and called {@code submitCustomGeometry} from
 * inside it (the same technique GeckoPlayerItemInHandLayer still uses for held items). That crashed intermittently
 * with a {@code ConcurrentModificationException} in {@code CustomFeatureRenderer.renderSolid}. Root cause, found by
 * decompiling GeckoLib's own render pipeline: the default {@code GeoRenderer#submitRenderTasks} queues the
 * player's own mesh render via {@code submitCustomGeometry}, and that queued callback is what eventually calls
 * {@code renderPassInfo.renderPosed(...)} to walk the bone tree and fire bone-position listeners - meaning those
 * listeners fire from *inside* {@code CustomFeatureRenderer.renderSolid}'s iteration over its
 * {@code solidCustomGeometrySubmits} map, during the draw phase, not the submit phase. Calling
 * {@code submitCustomGeometry} again from in there inserts a new key into that same map while it's being iterated
 * - a classic add-during-iteration bug, intermittent because Java's HashMap only throws when the fail-fast check
 * in the outer iterator's next() actually runs again afterwards (i.e. only when hash-bucket order happens to leave
 * more entries to visit after the mutated one - so it depends on what else is rendering that frame).
 * <p>
 * The fix, copied from GeckoLib's own built-in {@code ItemArmorGeoLayer} (which solves this exact "vanilla armor
 * riding a GeckoLib bone" problem for its own armor-slot rendering): call {@code renderPassInfo.renderPosed(...)}
 * directly and synchronously, once per bone/slot here, from {@code preRenderPass} - i.e. during the submit phase,
 * before the draw phase (and its live map iteration) has even begun. {@code renderPosed} is safe to call multiple
 * times per frame (its {@code boneUpdates} bake is memoized via {@code DeferredCache}, so repeat calls are cheap),
 * and {@code renderTasks.submitCustomGeometry(...)} calls made from within it land squarely in the submit phase,
 * with no nested nesting inside anyone else's draw callback.
 * <p>
 * Texture/dye-tint resolution is hand-rolled from EquipmentAssetManager/IClientItemExtensions rather than reusing
 * EquipmentLayerRenderer#renderLayers, since that method operates on one whole (multi-part) Model per call and
 * defers Model#setupAnim to an unspecified later point in the frame - both incompatible with rendering one
 * independent part at a time via the lower-level SubmitNodeCollector#submitModelPart. Armor trims and enchantment
 * glint are NOT reproduced here (out of scope for this pass, base texture + dye tint covers the reported case) -
 * if trims/glint are needed later, extend the loop in renderBone the same way EquipmentLayerRenderer#renderLayers
 * does (see that class for the trim/glint block to port over).

    // FOLLOW-UP FIX (chestplate sags down into the leggings during the swing; separately, the leggings' own "Body"
    // mapping - the waist/belt strip below the beltline - was confirmed via live diagnostic (disabling it made a
    // reported "phantom boot" disappear, at the cost of losing that strip's real coverage) to need the exact same
    // treatment): both CHEST's and LEGS' "Body" mappings ride the same "Body" GeoBone with the identical transform,
    // and use an essentially identical vanilla "body" cube shape (leggings' is only very slightly shrunk by
    // vanilla's own inner-armor deformation) - so this isn't the pivot-frame bug fixed above, it's that GeckoLib's
    // rig splits the torso into a Waist -> Body -> Neck chain for bendable-spine animation, and "Body"'s own pivot
    // sits low (near the waist, where vanilla's single rigid body box has no equivalent joint). Anchoring either
    // piece's full-height mesh there without correction leaves it hanging well below where it should be - for the
    // chestplate that reads as sagging into the leggings as the bone rotates; for the leggings' waist strip
    // (which barely rotates day-to-day) it reads as a static, boot-shaped mass sitting near the ground, since the
    // piece is anchored so far below its intended position that it clears the actual legs entirely. Lifting each
    // piece's own mesh origin (not the leg bones') compensates by making it behave as if anchored higher, closer to
    // where vanilla expects.
    // TRIED AND REVERTED: mirroring GeckoLib's own ItemArmorGeoLayer#getScaleFactorForBone (comparing the GeckoLib
    // bone's own cube size to the vanilla armor cube's size, and scaling the pose stack by the ratio) looked like
    // the more "correct", less-hacky fix for this and for a separate boots-tracking bug - but live-tested worse on
    // both: the chestplate ballooned to several times its normal size. This custom player rig is built to closely
    // match vanilla human proportions (it renders the player's own vanilla skin texture), so the two rigs' cube
    // sizes should already be near 1:1 - GeckoLib's formula is designed for genuinely differently-proportioned
    // custom mobs, and something about how it reads this rig's bone cube geometry (units, or which cube got
    // selected off a multi-cube bone) didn't hold here. Reverted to this hand-tuned constant; magnitude is a
    // visual-fit value, not derived from a fixed geometric ratio - retune here if the overlap direction reverses.
