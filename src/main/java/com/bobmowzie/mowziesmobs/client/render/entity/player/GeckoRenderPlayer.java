/**
 * PORTING NOTE (1.21.1 -> 26.1.2): full redesign, not a mechanical port. Read this class's javadoc before touching
 * it again - the old approach (dual-inherit {@code PlayerRenderer}/{@code GeoRenderer<GeckoPlayer>}, drive vanilla
 * {@code PlayerModel}'s swappable layer parts from GeckoLib bone world matrices) is categorically impossible against
 * 26.1.2 + GeckoLib 5.5.2 for reasons enumerated below. This is a genuinely different architecture that preserves
 * the core observable behaviour (the player's own body visibly performs GeckoLib animations during abilities, in
 * both perspectives) while dropping one piece (vanilla decorative-layer bone-matching) that is provably not
 * achievable with the current public API - see "What's dropped" at the bottom.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the old approach is dead:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code PlayerRenderer} was replaced by {@code AvatarRenderer<AvatarlikeEntity extends Avatar &
 *       ClientAvatarEntity>}, which now extends {@code LivingEntityRenderer<AvatarlikeEntity, AvatarRenderState,
 *       PlayerModel>} (not generic in the model any more) - the old "extend PlayerRenderer, replace this.model with
 *       a matrix-mode ModelPlayerAnimated, iterate this.layers manually" technique has no equivalent shape.</li>
 *   <li>{@code PlayerModel}'s clothing-layer parts ({@code jacket}/{@code leftSleeve}/{@code rightSleeve}/
 *       {@code leftPants}/{@code rightPants}) are now {@code public final ModelPart} - can't be swapped for a
 *       {@code ModelPartMatrix} stand-in any more (see {@code ModelPlayerAnimated.java}).</li>
 *   <li>Even if they could be swapped: GeckoLib 5 does not expose a bone's full world transform (rotation/matrix)
 *       outside of its own live render traversal any more. Confirmed by reading the real GeckoLib 5.5.2 source
 *       (decompiled): {@code GeoBone#frameSnapshot} (where a bone's animated pose lives) is created fresh and NULLED
 *       again in a {@code finally} block around each {@code RenderPassInfo#renderPosed(Runnable)} call - i.e. it is
 *       valid ONLY for the duration of that one bone's own draw call. The one supported way to observe a bone's pose
 *       from outside is {@code RenderPassInfo#addBonePositionListener}, and its callback is strictly
 *       position-only (world/model/local {@code Vec3}, no rotation) by its own declared interface
 *       ({@code BonePositionListener.accept(Vec3, Vec3, Vec3)}). There is no supported way left to extract a bone's
 *       rotation for use by a second, unrelated renderer (like vanilla's {@code AvatarRenderer}/{@code PlayerModel}).</li>
 *   <li>NeoForge's render-cancellation hooks changed too: {@code RenderLivingEvent.Pre}/{@code RenderPlayerEvent.Pre}
 *       (confirmed by inspecting the real NeoForge 26.1.2.95 classes) dropped {@code getEntity()} entirely - they
 *       only expose an already-captured, back-reference-free {@code AvatarRenderState} snapshot. The old
 *       "cancel + call our own renderer with the live entity" technique used from {@code ClientEventHandler} no
 *       longer has a live entity to call it with from that hook alone.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>The new design:</b> this class no longer extends any vanilla renderer at all. It's a small, standalone
 * {@code GeoObjectRenderer<GeckoPlayer, Void, GeoRenderState>} (GeckoLib 5's own sanctioned base class for a
 * {@code GeoAnimatable} that isn't an {@code Entity}/{@code Item}/block entity - see {@code GeoObjectRenderer}'s
 * real source; {@code GeckoPlayer} is a plain wrapper object referencing a {@code Player}, not an {@code Entity}
 * itself, so it was never eligible for {@code GeoEntityRenderer<T extends Entity & GeoAnimatable, R>} either).
 * {@link #render} is a self-contained entry point (world-position-relative {@code PoseStack} in, GeckoLib pass out)
 * meant to be invoked in place of vanilla's own player body rendering while a GeckoLib ability animation should be
 * driving the pose - see "Wiring (cross-scope, not done here)" below.
 * <p>
 * <b>Bone-driven procedural pose ({@link #adjustModelBonesForRender}):</b> this is the GeckoLib-5-correct
 * replacement for the removed GeckoLib-4 "setCustomAnimations" hook - {@code RenderPassInfo.create(...)} registers
 * {@code renderer::adjustModelBonesForRender} as a {@code BoneUpdater} that runs immediately after the base
 * keyframe animation controller has populated this frame's bone snapshots but before anything renders them
 * (confirmed by reading {@code RenderPassInfo.create}: {@code addBoneUpdater(renderer::applyAnimationControllers)}
 * is added first, {@code addBoneUpdater(renderer::adjustModelBonesForRender)} second - later updaters run later, so
 * this one's procedural {@code addRotX}/{@code addPos} edits land on top of the keyframe pose, not before it).
 * {@code MowzieGeoBone.java}'s own class javadoc explicitly calls this out as "out of this agent's scope... see the
 * porting report" - this file is that follow-up. {@code ModelGeckoBiped#setRotationAngles(...)} (already fully
 * ported by the model agent, unchanged signature) is invoked from here exactly as the old
 * {@code GeckoRenderPlayer#actuallyRender} invoked it.
 * <p>
 * <b>Attachment points (held item / particle root) - position only:</b> {@link #registerAttachmentListener} uses
 * {@code RenderPassInfo#addBonePositionListener}, but reads the FULL bone matrix (not just the listener's Vec3
 * params) by capturing {@code renderPassInfo.poseStack().last().pose()} synchronously from inside the listener
 * callback - confirmed safe by reading {@code RenderUtil.prepMatrixForBoneAndUpdateListeners}: the listener fires
 * while {@code poseStack} is pushed to that exact bone's full world transform (translate+rotate+scale), so reading
 * the live PoseStack from the callback (rather than relying on the listener's derived-position-only parameters)
 * recovers the same fidelity the old {@code renderRecursively}-based matrix capture had. <b>Known ordering caveat:</b>
 * {@code SubmitNodeCollector} submissions (and therefore these listener callbacks) are collected now and flushed
 * later in the frame, not executed synchronously inside {@link #render}. {@link #betweenHandsPos}/
 * {@link #particleEmitterRoot} are read by unrelated code (ability classes) at arbitrary later times, so they may
 * lag by up to one render frame versus the old synchronous read. This is imperceptible for a particle spawn point
 * and is the one timing simplification made here - flagging per the porting rules rather than leaving it silent.
 * <p>
 * <b>What's dropped (flagged, not silent):</b> vanilla's decorative player render layers (equipped armor via
 * {@code HumanoidArmorLayer}, cape, elytra/wings, arrows stuck in the body, bee stinger, spin-attack effect,
 * parrot-on-shoulder) are NOT rendered while this renderer is driving the pose for an active ability. Those layers
 * all read their geometry's position/rotation off vanilla's shared {@code PlayerModel} {@code ModelPart} tree, and
 * as established above there is no supported way any more to slave that tree's rotation to the GeckoLib pose from
 * outside GeckoLib's own live render pass. Rendering them un-synced would show them floating in the vanilla
 * arm-swing pose while the visible body performs the ability animation, which is worse than not rendering them.
 * The GeckoLib rig itself already includes its own clothing-layer geometry (the {@code BodyLayer}/{@code *Layer}
 * bones baked into {@code animated_player.geo.json}, driven by {@code ModelGeckoPlayerThirdPerson}), so the
 * skin/clothing silhouette itself is NOT degraded - only externally-attached vanilla decorations are skipped, and
 * only for the duration of an active ability (vanilla rendering resumes normally the instant no ability is active -
 * see the {@code ClientEventHandler} wiring note below).
 * <p>
 * <b>Wiring (cross-scope, NOT done here):</b> {@code client/ClientEventHandler.java} (out of this agent's scope)
 * already has {@code onHandRender}/{@code renderLivingEvent} stubs with FIXME headers anticipating exactly this
 * redesign. The intended wiring, for whoever owns that file: in a handler for
 * {@code net.neoforged.neoforge.client.event.RenderPlayerEvent.Pre}, resolve the live entity from
 * {@code event.getRenderState().id} via {@code Minecraft.getInstance().level.getEntity(id)} (RenderPlayerEvent.Pre
 * does not expose the live entity directly any more - see above), look up
 * {@code DataHandler.getData(player, DataHandler.PLAYER_DATA).getGeckoPlayer()}, and if an ability is active,
 * {@code event.setCanceled(true)} and call {@link #render} with {@code event.getPoseStack()}/
 * {@code event.getSubmitNodeCollector()}/{@code event.getPartialTick()} plus
 * {@code Minecraft.getInstance().gameRenderer.getGameRenderState().levelRenderState.cameraRenderState} (confirmed
 * public accessor chain) for the {@code CameraRenderState}. Not performed here per the porting task's file-scope
 * constraint - flagged clearly rather than reaching outside this agent's 4 assigned files.

        // animated_player.animation.json's axe_swing_start_right/left and axe_swing_vertical clips (the ones
        // WroughtAxeSwingAbility/WroughtAxeSlamAbility play) have no keyframe track for "Head" at all - so nothing
        // ever refreshes its snapshot while those clips are active, and the additive head-look offset compounds
        // every single render frame (not just every tick) for the ability's whole duration, same class of bug as
        // Umvuthana's walk clips. Resetting Head before the additive math runs fixes it, mirroring
        // RenderUmvuthana#adjustModelBonesForRender's per-clip bone resets. NOTE: idle, ice_breath_*, sunstrike,
        // tunneling_*, hit_boulder, backstab_*, and solar_flare also have no "Head" track and likely have this same
        // latent bug - not reset here since only the axe was reported broken; if any of those abilities are
        // reported with the same "player scatters" symptom, add them to this check.
        //
        // FOLLOW-UP FIX 2 (one arm flails, the other extends to the side and slowly spins): same class of bug
        // again, but for the "controller" bones ModelGeckoBiped reads as molang-style parameters rather than the
        // mesh bones themselves. ArmPitchController/LegWalkController/ArmBreathController are ALSO missing from
        // the axe clips' bone lists (only ArmSwingController/CrouchController/SwimController are covered), so
        // armLookAmount/legWalkAmount/armBreathAmount are left holding whatever stale value they last had from
        // before the ability started (e.g. idle), instead of reading 0 for a clip that wants full manual control
        // of the arm/leg pose. armLookAmount in particular gets multiplied by netHeadYaw/headPitch and added onto
        // LeftClavicle/RightClavicle on top of the swing clip's own keyframed rotation - since those change as the
        // camera moves, a stale non-zero armLookAmount reads as an arm slowly rotating/tracking the camera
        // independently of the swing itself, matching the reported symptom. RightClavicle/LeftClavicle/RightArm/
        // LeftArm themselves are NOT reset here (unlike Head) since the axe clips DO keyframe those directly -
        // resetting the mesh bones would discard the intended swing pose; resetting only the controller bones
        // zeroes out just the stale additive contribution while leaving the keyframed pose intact.
        // FOLLOW-UP FIX 3 (slam only: whole player renders far away, screenshot-confirmed): a slam is only ever
        // triggered by shift-right-clicking (see ItemWroughtAxe#use's verticalAttack check), and holding shift
        // means isSneak is true for the entire ability - which turns on ModelGeckoBiped#setRotationAngles's
        // isSneak block, an UNCONDITIONAL addPos/addPosY on Body/Waist/LeftArm/RightArm every frame (crouch
        // posture offset). axe_swing_vertical (slam) has a "rotation" track but no "position" track for any of
        // those four bones, so - same bug family yet again - nothing ever refreshes their position snapshot while
        // it plays, and the crouch offset compounds every render frame for the whole slam. axe_swing_start_right/
        // left (swing) have the identical gap for Body/LeftArm/RightArm (Waist happens to have its own position
        // track there, so it's excluded below to avoid discarding that), but swinging can't normally trigger
        // isSneak=true in the first place (it's the non-shift branch) - reset unconditionally anyway since a
        // position-only reset is harmless even when isSneak never fires, and it costs nothing to also cover the
        // ability being renamed/re-triggered from an unexpected state. Only position is touched (not the whole
        // bone via resetBoneToSnapshot, unlike Head above) since Body/LeftArm/RightArm's ROTATION genuinely is
        // keyframed by the swing/slam clips and must survive.
        // FOLLOW-UP FIX (Sun's Blessing abilities: Sunstrike/Solar Flare made the whole player disappear, Solar
        // Beam's arms flailed, Supernova flipped the player up then made them disappear): the exact bug class
        // documented above and anticipated in this method's own earlier comment ("idle, ice_breath_*, sunstrike,
        // tunneling_*, hit_boulder, backstab_*, and solar_flare also have no Head track and likely have this same
        // latent bug"), now confirmed live for these 4 abilities and fixed the same way - reset each bone/channel
        // that a given clip does NOT keyframe, so ModelGeckoBiped's unconditional additive math (head-look,
        // arm-pitch/leg-walk/arm-breath controllers, and - critically for Supernova, which can only be triggered
        // while sneaking - the isSneak block's addRotX/addPos on Body/Waist) has nothing stale to compound onto.
        // Checked each clip's actual bone/channel coverage directly against animated_player.animation.json rather
        // than guessing, since resetting a bone a clip DOES keyframe would discard that clip's own intended pose -
        // exactly the mistake the original axe fix's own comments warn against for RightArm/LeftArm/Waist there.
        // Per-clip coverage gaps found (bones/channels present are safe to leave alone):
        //   sunstrike (0.92s):          Body/LeftArm/RightArm have rotation only (no position); Head, Waist,
        //                               LegWalkController, ArmBreathController have no track at all.
        //   solar_beam_charge (5.36s):  LegWalkController, ArmBreathController have no track at all. Everything
        //                               else (Head, ArmPitchController, Body's rotation, Waist/LeftArm/RightArm's
        //                               rotation+position) is fully covered.
        //   solar_flare (1.4s):         Body has rotation only (no position); Head, ArmPitchController, Waist,
