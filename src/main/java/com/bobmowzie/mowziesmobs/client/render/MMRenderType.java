/**
 * PORTING NOTE: vanilla's `RenderType` construction API was completely rebuilt around a declarative
 * `RenderPipeline`/`RenderSetup` system (see PORTING_NOTES.md "RenderType/RenderTypes split" section) - the old
 * `RenderType.CompositeState`/`RenderStateShard` (`TextureStateShard`, `ShaderStateShard`, `TransparencyStateShard`,
 * etc) API this file used no longer exists at all. `highlight(...)` had an exact modern vanilla replacement
 * (`net.minecraft.client.renderer.rendertype.RenderTypes#energySwirl(Identifier, float, float)` matches it almost
 * field-for-field - offset-scrolling texture, lightmap, overlay, additive-ish energy shader) so callers of
 * `MMRenderType.highlight(...)` should be updated to call `RenderTypes.energySwirl(...)` directly (this method has
 * been removed from this class - grep for `MMRenderType.highlight` if any other file still references it and
 * update it to `RenderTypes.energySwirl`).
 * `getGlowingEffect`/`getSolarFlare` have no exact vanilla equivalent (both are bespoke unlit/translucent
 * beacon-beam-styled effects) - rebuilt here as custom `RenderPipeline`s cloned from vanilla's
 * `RenderPipelines.BEACON_BEAM_SNIPPET` (closest existing analog to the old `RENDERTYPE_BEACON_BEAM_SHADER`), with
 * the vertex format overridden to `DefaultVertexFormat.ENTITY` (closest modern equivalent of the old
 * `DefaultVertexFormat.NEW_ENTITY`, needed since the mod's own vertex-building code, e.g.
 * `RenderUmvuthi#drawVertex`, calls `.setOverlay(...)`/`.setLight(...)`, which BLOCK-format pipelines don't support).
 * **This is a best-effort reconstruction, not a verified 1:1 port - the exact GPU pipeline/shader compatibility of
 * pairing the beacon-beam shader with an overridden ENTITY vertex format could not be verified without running the
 * game; if the solar flare / glow effects render incorrectly or fail to draw, start here.**
 * <p>
 * Also note: this class used to `extends RenderType` (subclassing it purely to reach its protected/inherited
 * static shard/state constants like `TRANSLUCENT_TRANSPARENCY`, `NO_CULL`, etc, which no longer exist). The new
 * `RenderType`'s constructor is private (`RenderType.create(name, RenderSetup)` is the only way to build one), so
 * subclassing it is no longer possible or necessary - this is now a plain utility class.

    // pipeline had instead inherited BEACON_BEAM_SNIPPET's DepthStencilState.DEFAULT (test LEQUAL, write *true*),
    // so each shell's near faces stamped the depth buffer and occluded shells/faces drawn after them instead of
    // blending - translucency looked broken/patchy. (A prior pass here tried CompareOp.ALWAYS_PASS - i.e.
    // disabling the depth test entirely - which is wrong: it matches SOLAR_FLARE_PIPELINE's old NO_DEPTH_TEST
    // behavior, not this pipeline's. With the test genuinely disabled, translucent geometry no longer gets
    // properly occluded by solid terrain/entities in front of it either - confirmed as the actual root cause of a
    // separate "screen-filling wash" bug on the particle pipeline below, which had the same wrong CompareOp.)

    // tree, and its own OPAQUE/TRANSLUCENT/OPAQUE_TERRAIN/TRANSLUCENT_TERRAIN constants for the pattern this
    // follows). Field names changed (PARTICLE_SHEET_TRANSLUCENT_NO_DEPTH -> PARTICLE_LAYER_TRANSLUCENT_NO_DEPTH,
    // TERRAIN_SHEET_NO_CULL -> TERRAIN_LAYER_NO_CULL) to match the new type; verified no other file under
    // client/render/** referenced the old names before renaming - the particle-subsystem files that consume these
    // (ParticleSparkle, ParticleSnowFlake, ParticleCloud, ParticleOrb, ParticleRing, AdvancedParticleBase,
    // AdvancedTerrainParticle) are out of this agent's scope and were updated by the particle-subsystem agent to use
    // the new names.
    // FOLLOW-UP FIX: confirmed against the actual pre-port 1.21.1 source (MMRenderType.PARTICLE_SHEET_TRANSLUCENT_NO_DEPTH's

    // With the test genuinely disabled, ItemElokosaPaw's ground burst/glow particles (which legitimately grow
    // larger than the camera's distance from them, by design, unchanged since 1.21) drew straight through the
    // player's own body and the ground instead of being occluded by them like solid geometry - confirmed live via
    // a debug-instrumented build of the actual 1.21.1 client running side-by-side (git worktree), which reproduces
    // the exact same oversized-quad-vs-camera-distance numbers but renders a correctly occluded, gradiented ring
    // instead of a screen-filling flat wash. Restoring the normal depth test fixes both symptoms without touching
    // any of the mod's own scale/color values.
